	<h3>What are the main action(s) the site is designed to encourage?</h3>
<p>I think the main action the site is designed to do is encourage streaming of music from Los Campesinos! Heart Swells, live, news, and music all give information about the band’s discography and where to find them on their next tour. This makes up four out of the seven links on the home page. The other three buttons lead to merch, information about the band, and social media. Typically, it’s hard to tell whether or not a website for a band is made to mainly promote merch, and while some are, I don’t think this one is. The shop feature doesn’t stand out in any way and it’s not too in your face about buying the band’s merch.</p>

<h3>Intended audience </h3>
<p>I believe the intended audience of this site is Los Campesinos! fans, specifically the young adult ones. These are people who are interested in their merch and want to keep up with them on social media.</p>
