	<h2>Navigation</h2>
	<p>While I think navigation could be improved on mobile, <em>Amazing Thailand</em>’s navigation is solid. There is a home, destination, experiences, plan your trip, and languages tab when you first open the site. When you scroll down, there are tabs to explore Thailand’s culture. This allows for the average website viewer to find everything that there is to know about Thailand in an effective manner. It does however get overwhelming when you press some of the tabs because it drops down a menu of other categories of the site to visit. I do not think this is a fault of the website’s design however because of how much information there is about their location.</p>
		
	<h2>Usability</h2>
	<p>The site is usable on multiple devices, however the header image of the site is cut off on mobile. This wouldn’t be a bad thing, but the image used is already poor-quality, so the cut off of the image makes the flaws of the quality increasingly obvious. There is also an accessibility feature that does not do anything. It does not change fonts, make things easier to be explained, or anything I could find. The browser tab also doesn’t offer every category to skip to unless you use a drop down menu, unlike on a laptop. I think this makes the site less accessible because while it’s usable, the site’s responsiveness makes it hard to click anything. There is a plus side to the site though and it’s that they are very language accessible with about 17 languages in its catalog!</p>
	
	<h2>Typography and Hierarchy</h2>
	<p>Overall, the typography of <em>AmazingThailand</em> is okay. There’s a consistent color scheme of dark blues, vibrant pinks, and greys used for the type. Though I think the choice of having vibrant pink on dark blue is hard to read, this doesn’t come up much except for the <em>Explore Bangkok</em> section. The grey used for the regular bodies of text is also good as it doesn’t contrast too much with the off-white of the background. There is also a clear hierarchy with the header being several sizes larger than the body of text and the headers being defined.</p>
	
	<h2>Overall style/look and feel</h2>
	<p>Overall, the style of the site could use some work. There are things that are effective, and things that are not. I like the color scheme, but sometimes it’s too much. Usability could be better for both disabled viewers who need accessibility and the non-disabled. Usability helps everyone in the end and what I think would help this problem is better response times. The website also has some issues with image quality and it makes the site seem poorly made even if half their images are good. Overall, I will take what this site does well and incorporate into my projects while studying the things I don’t think work here.</p>
